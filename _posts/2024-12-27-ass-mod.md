# Amy Becomes a Moderator

I haven't posted in a while.  I'm still getting used to the whole blogging thing.

Yesterday I was elected as an associate moderator in my favorite community.  Most of you probably already know.  There has been a shortage of staff so we've decided to elect two new mods, and I'm the first one in.  I hope to be a really good and fair moderator.

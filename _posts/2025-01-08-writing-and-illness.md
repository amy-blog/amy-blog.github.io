# Amy's January 2025 Writing and Illness

## Writing

So I started writing again.  As is to be expected, I did ok yet I'm very embarrassed to share my writing.  But whatever, it's always like this.  I hope I write more.  I want to write like 8 short stories and then try to write a novella, but what will end up happeing probably is I write one short story then get too embarrassed to continue for a long while, and when I come back I start over.  That's usually how these things go.  I hope it's different this time.  The world doesn't need my writing, but I need the world to have my writing.  I'll post a link at the bottom to the first chapter of my first short story.

## Illness

Wow, I have something bad.  My temperature has been in the 100s F since the third and I just feel awful.  Worse than when I had COVID.  My temperature reached 103.2 F (39.6 C) at the highest reading this time around, and that was *with* pyrolytics!  I'm doing much better today, hence my ability to blog, but my wife is sick too now and I'm worried about her.  Wish us well, please.
